# Cplusplus-Program
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
- This project was a scenario to create a C++ program that read in a .txt file and output a reformatted version of the data to a user and saved that data to a new file.  
What did you do particularly well?
- I think the thing that I did well was writing the code in a clear and readable way that is easy to follow. 
 
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
- I could enhance my code by creating more input validation. It was optional in this assignment but would be useful in a real world situation. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
- I think the most challenging part of the code to write was the code for converting the data into different formats. It wasn't hard but just took some more thinking and testing than the rest of it. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
- I think all the skills from this project will be transferable to other projects and course work. I had to use a little of everything we have learned to create this program and it is very useful information that helps build on my knowledge of programming. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- To make the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable I used best practices when creating my code. I used naming convestions appropriate to the data, in-line commenting, and appropriate formatting to keep my code clean and friendly.
